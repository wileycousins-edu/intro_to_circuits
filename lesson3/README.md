# intro to circuits lesson 3
all about transistors!

## what is a transistor?
Transistors are the backbone of our digital world. There are millions of them in the computer you're on right now. I've given you twenty. They look a lot like this:

A transistor is a lot like a valve controlling water flow, except it controls current flow. It can be closed, partially open, or fully open.

## types of transistors
The transistors that you have are called bi-polar junction transistors, or BJTs. They are so-called because they rely on a sandwich of two types of semiconductors. If you care about any of this, I highly recommend [the wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor).

The semiconductors are referred to as N-type and P-type. Because the BJT is a sandwich of these two materials, there are two possible configurations: NPN and PNP.

### NPN BJTs
You have five NPN transistors with the model number 2N3904. You can see this written in very small letters on the flat face of the transistor.

The symbol for an NPN transistor is this:
