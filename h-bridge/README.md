# intro to circuits - the h-bridge
The circuit that looks like an 'h'

## why use an h-bridge?
If we have a motor, we often want to be able to make that motor go either forwards or backwards. A motor will turn one way if current is flowing through it in one direction, and it will turn the other way if current is flowing in the other direction.

**An h-bridge allows us to send current in either direction through a motor to change its rotational direction.**

## what is an h-bridge?

## building an h-bridge

### step 1 - control a motor with a PNP transistor

### step 2 - add an NPN transistor at the low side

### step 3 - re
