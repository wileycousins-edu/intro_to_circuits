# introduction to circuits
Electrons and whatnot

## class schedule and subjects
Subjects for future classes are tentative and dependent on the progress we make. The year for all dates is 2014 because that is this year.

**If you miss a class, review the posted material and come to the next class 30 min early with questions for a recap session.**

## how to use this repository

* General tool setup and use lives in `gettingstarted`
* Circuits and presentations from each lesson live in `lesson1,2,etc`

### lesson recaps on google drive

### saving this stuff to your computer
You can keep all this on your computer in one of several ways:

* [Download the entire repository as a zip file](https://github.com/wileycousins-edu/intro_to_circuits/archive/master.zip)
    * You'll have to do this every time the repository gets updated
* Use git (recommended)
    * With git, you can pull in new changes without having to re-download everything
    * What is git? Git is what makes GitHub great. [Learn how to set it up here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

### feedback
While using this repository, if you find something confusing, contridictory, incorrect, or otherwise questionable, click [here or on the "Issues" button](https://github.com/wileycousins-edu/intro_to_circuits/issues) and open up an issue. Your feedback is helpful and much appreciated, and if it's all collected here, it's a nice to-do list for me to fix things.

## recommended software

You should download [fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) to view and edit the raw circuit files from which the images are exported.

You should also take a look at [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/), an online circuit editor and simulator.

And, as mentioned earlier, you should download git (if you know how to use the command line), [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/) (if you use a Mac), or [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) (if you use Windows) so you can keep the class material up to date on your computer with very little effort.

## recommended reading
This list will grow as the class progresses. My apologies if it is only Wikipedia links right now.

## thanks
Thanks to Mike Mitterer, whose [Fritzing multimeter](https://github.com/MikeMitterer/fritzing-multimeter) is used in the fritzing circuits for this class.
